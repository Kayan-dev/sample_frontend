I build a minimalistic frontend React application to upload en download CSV files. 

In order to test out this frontend application simply clone this repository using 'git clone git@github.com:Kayan-dev/sample_frontend.git' 
into a folder of your liking and type as command 'npm run start' in the folder you cloned the repository too. 

Do you want to check it now?
Then use the link below for deployed site using Netlify:
https://616f09a01569620007a24b01--boring-benz-9ff76e.netlify.app/

It is a continuous deployment from git(hub).

The technological stack is:
1) React
2) Redux
3) Javascript 6+, HTML5, CSS3

Some packages that are noteworthy:
- particles.js to make an alive background.
- react-data-table to make the table component
- xlsx & react-csv to read, upload & download csv files
- React Router in order to route to different pages


Application Architecture is shown below with a sitemap
