I build a minimalistic frontend React application to upload en download CSV files. 

The technological stack is:
1) React
2) Redux
3) Javascript 6+, HTML5, CSS3

Some packages that are noteworthy:
- particles.js to make a moving background
- react-data-table to make the table component
- xlsx & react-csv to read the csv files
- React Router in order to route to different pages


Application Architecture incl. sitemap
